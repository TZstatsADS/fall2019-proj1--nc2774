### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2019

+ Projec title: Finding the true meaning of lyrics
+ This project is conducted by [Nyu Chai]

+ Project summary: Which part of music attracts you most? Lyrics, melody, generes or music video? All of those can be the reason people like that specific song. In order to find the interesting part of lyrics, in this project, i would analyze lyrics data to obtain most common words through wordcloud, words frequency and apply sentiment analysis.
